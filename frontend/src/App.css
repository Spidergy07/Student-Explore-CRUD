/* Styles in this file are no longer needed as we are primarily using Tailwind CSS */
/* You can add custom non-Tailwind CSS for App.tsx here if necessary */

/*
  IMPORTANT: The primary Tailwind CSS setup (import, theme, layers) 
  should ideally be in a single global CSS file like index.css to avoid redundancy and potential conflicts.

  This App.css file is structured as requested, but consider if these declarations
  are needed here or if they should be solely managed by index.css.

  If App.css is used, it should typically be for component-specific styles for App.tsx
  that cannot be achieved with Tailwind utility classes or are too complex for inline application.
